A Blogging Websites Designed From the Back-End using Google App Engine

Created my first website that is accessible through the link:
http://terrence-kuo-websites.appspot.com/blog

I designed this website using what I learned from Udacity's Web Development Course taught by Steve Huffman.

Python (main.py) is the primary languaged used for the backend development using:
webapp2 module
google.appengine.ext db module 
jinj2 template module.

Frontend Development used:
bootstrap.css

From this program I learned how to use:
1) google app engine: creating my own website that is avaliable on the internet
2) databases: SQlite/GQL/SQL syntax to store my information on an external base
3) templating engine: using Jinja2 as a templating engine for Python
4) internet: how the internet work
